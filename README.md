# SNL Analytics: Cast, Skits, and Ratings Insights Dashboard

## Overview

The **SNL Analytics Dashboard** project comprehensively analyzes Saturday Night Live (SNL) by examining historical data on cast members, skits, and episode ratings. This interactive dashboard leverages Python for data extraction, cleaning, and advanced analysis, PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and querying, and Power BI for creating dynamic visualizations. The project aims to uncover trends in cast performance, evaluate the popularity of different skits, and forecast future episode ratings. The dashboard provides valuable insights into factors that drive show ratings and audience engagement by integrating data from various sources and applying predictive modeling techniques. It allows users to explore cast longevity, skit themes, and viewership patterns, offering a detailed look at what makes SNL a staple of American television.

## Initial Questions

- What are the trends in episode ratings over different seasons of SNL?  
- How does the presence of specific cast members influence episode ratings?  
- Which skit types or themes are most associated with higher viewership?  
- How do different hosts affect the ratings of their respective episodes?  
- Are there notable patterns or anomalies in ratings based on the time of year?  
- What are the forecasted ratings for future episodes, and how do historical trends inform these predictions?

## Data

All datasets used in this project were sourced from the SNL Dataset available on Kaggle. The raw data files were downloaded as CSVs and processed to remove any unnecessary formatting. These CSV files were then uploaded to GitHub for easy access and loading into the analysis environment. Upon loading, each dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process, including handling missing values and standardizing column names. Only relevant data points were retained for analysis to ensure clarity and focus on key insights.
